A study project for practicing react-Bootstrap5.

### About this project

There is one cover page with differents components which responsive to differents sizes.

### Tools and technologies

The stack of the project is: react, react-router-dom, react-bootstrap, library classNames.

I used the classNames library in this project because it gives us the opportunity to combine css and bootstrap styles, I used media queries for screen adaptability, and if I could shorten the code, I used a method where I added the main elements to an array and used the map method to display the data.


### What I've learned

In the project I've learned what is react-router and how to use it. 

I've learned how works react-bootstrap.
I've learned new library classNames.
I've remind how works media-queries.
